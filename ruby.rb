    ```
    puts "Hello World"

    # puts can print multiple things, each on a new line
    puts(1, 2, "dog", "cat")

    # don't have to use brackets
    puts 1, 2, "dog", "cat"

    # print will join these two strings together on same line
    print("a", "b")

    # also can use without brackets
    print "a", "b"

You can put sums inside the string
`puts "Here is a string with math #{3 + 5}"`
